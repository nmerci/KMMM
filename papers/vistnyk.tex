\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
A problem of lifetime distribution estimation from randomly right-censored observations naturally appears in actuarial and medical statistics as well as in device reliability analysis $\#$. In case of independent identically distributed observations \emph{Kaplan-Meier estimator} is usually used $\#$. Consider a model in which each observation is drawn from a finite mixture of distributions. If mixture probabilities (concentrations) varies through the observations, this model is called \emph{mixture model with varying concentrations}. A modification of Kaplan-Meier estimator for this model has already been discussed by V. Khizanov, R. Maiboroda and A. Ryzhov in papers $\#$. In this paper two different estimators (modifications) are compared via numerical simulations.

The problem statement is formulated in Section \ref{sec:Problem_statement}. Sections \ref{sec:Simulation_description} and \ref{sec:Simulation_results} are devoted to description and results of simulations respectively. Conclusions are presented in Section \ref{sec:Conclusions}.

\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:Problem_statement}
Let $\mathcal O = \{O_j\}_{j=1}^n$ be a sample from mixture model with varying concentrations. Each $O_j$ belongs to one of $M$ components which is denoted by $\mathrm{ind}(O_j)$. Suppose that the true value of $\mathrm{ind}(O_j)$ is not observed. Instead, one is provided with \emph{mixture probabilities}
\begin{equation}
w_j^m = \mathbb P(\mathrm{ind}(O_j) = m)\, ,m=1,\ldots, M
\end{equation}
For each object $O_j$ there exists a positive characteristic $\xi _j = \xi (O_j)$ which is treated as a lifetime. Distribution of each $\xi _j$ depends on the component it belongs to, i.e.:
\begin{equation}
F_m (A) = \mathbb P(\xi _j \in A \mid \mathrm{ind}(O_j) = m)\, , m=1,\ldots , M
\end{equation}

Consider the case in which \emph{true data} $\mathcal D = \{\xi _j\}_{j=1}^n$ are randomly right-censored. That is there exists a sequence of positive random variables $\{c_j\}_{j=1}^n$ such that only \emph{censored data} $\mathcal D^c = \{(\xi _j^*, \delta _j)\}_{j=1}^n$, where $\xi _j^* = \min (\xi _j, c_j)$ and $\delta _j = \mathbf 1\{\xi _j \leq c_j\}$ for each $j=1,\ldots ,n$, are observed. Here, $c_j$'s are called \emph{censors} and their conditional distributions are given by:
\begin{equation}
G_m (A) = \mathbb P(c _j \in A \mid \mathrm{ind}(O_j) = m)\, , m=1,\ldots , M
\end{equation} 

One problem is to estimate conditional distributions $\{F_m\}_{m=1}^M$ from censored data $\mathcal D^c$ and mixture probabilities $\mathbf W = (w_j^m)_{j,m=1}^{n,M}$. Vectors $(\xi _j, c _j)$ are assumed to be independent as well as variables $\xi _j$ and $c_j$ are conditionally independent given $\mathrm{ind}(O_j)$ for each $j=1,\ldots ,n$. Two solutions for this problem are considered in subsequent sections.
